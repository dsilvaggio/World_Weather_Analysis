# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
  PlanMyTrip app is a new application that allows users to search for locations that they want to travel to based on certain preferences. During the Beta test, many users recommended a few changes to the app. These changes included adding the weather description to the weather data, and then allowing users to use input statements to filter possible travel destinations based on their weather preferences. The app will then be able to give a list of potetential travel destinations with hotel recommendations, and users will be able to pick up to four cities from this list and create a travel itinerary. The app will then be able to use Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
